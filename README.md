In this project we will go through 6 datasets in excel where we will clean and filter the data. Later we will analyze and visualize the data insights through PowerBi.

Conclusion:

Among other causes, a lack of family planning makes it possible for more deaths to occur. A high population could make facilities and resources available not effectively utilized, and therefore family planning should be highly encouraged
Preventive measures like child health education, encouraging healthy lifestyles and a culture of good cleanliness, sexual health campaigns, and public health initiatives should all be put in place in other to control these deadly diseases that cause more deaths, especially to infants.
The age group 70+ recorded the most deaths. To stop this trend in its tracks, we advise people to choose healthy lifestyle in order to stay healthy in their late 70's.


There should be an implementation of a global strategy on human resources for health like:
1. Building more Healthcare infrastructures like primary Healthcare facilities were people can have access to these  primary services especially the infants.
2. Increasing the incentives for Healthcare workers


Note: During data cleaning and processing I observed there were few missing data in the datasets for some years. Due to this the analyzing is not 100% accurate.
